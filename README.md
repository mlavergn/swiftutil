# Swift Util

### Swift utility package.

Introduction
--
This a collection of helper classes and extensions that I've used in some projects. There are bits that might prove interesting interesting to others. 

Dependencies
--
Assumptions are iOS 10.x / macOS 10.12.x, but it may work on earlier revs.

The are no external dependencies beyond Apple's Frameworks. So this is somewhat platform independent, so long as that platform is one of Apple's.


Installation
--
```bash
make
```

## Warning

This package is based Swift 3.0 syntax, until we reach a stable ABI, mayhem may still ensue.
